Use docker to containerise a Python-flask application that uses a HTML form for frontend and Postgres database to store the information from the form and display the data in a table using simple HTML. Fast API is used to send the data from the form to the database. A database management adminer is used to check the working of the database in the backend. The end goa is to use docker and docker-compose to create isolated containers for each of these services database, Api, adminer and web-app. The database and Api are linked to the common network backend and the web-app is linked to the network frontend.
